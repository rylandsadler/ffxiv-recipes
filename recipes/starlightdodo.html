    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the neck and trim the excess fat and skin from the duck. Place the duck, breast side up, in a mesh strainer set over a sink. In a large pot, bring about 6 cups of water to a boil. Pour half of the water over the duck. Turn the duck over and pour the remaining water over it. This will tighten the skin.</li>
        <li>Transfer the duck to a wire rack set on a baking sheet. generously salt all parts of the duck. Tie the legs together with butcher's twine. Refrigerate the  duck, uncovered, for 12 to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F. Remove the duck from the refrigerator and pat dry. Season all parts of the duck with pepper. Stuff the duck cavity with garlic, shallot, lemon, orange, and rosemary. Place the duck, breast side up, back on the wire rack on the baking sheet. Bake in the oven for 1 hour. Turn the buck over and bake for another 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the ingredients for the glaze. Remove the duck from the oven and brush the back with the glaze. Return to the oven and back for another 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the duck from the oven, turn it over, brush with the glaze, and return the duck to the oven. Bake for 20 minutes. Brush the duck once more with the glaze and bake until the duck registers 160 F on a meat thermometer inserted into the breast. Remove the duck from the oven and wrap in aluminum foil. Let rest for 25 minutes before carving.</li>
