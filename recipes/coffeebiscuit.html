        <p><i>Y'know, they broke the economy with these once, but that's a story for another day.</i></p>

      <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon espresso powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon hot water</li>
            <li>2 /12 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>1/2 cup beet sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>8 ounces dark chocolate chips</li>
            
        </ul>
     <p>Instructions:</p>
       <ol>
             <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the espresso powder and hot water. In a medium bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, salt, and baking powder.</li>
             <li>In a large bowl, combine the butter, beet sugar and brown sugar and mix until smooth. Add the eggs, vanilla, and espresso powder mixture. Slowly mix in the flour mixture until the dough just comes together. Fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
             <li>Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Divide the dough into 50 gram-sized (about 2 1/2 tablespoons) balls and place on a prepared baking sheet. Using the palm of your hand, gently press each ball down on the parchment paper to make a thick disk. Place the baking sheets in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
             <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the cookies on the baking sheet with 2-inches of space between each. Bake the cookies until they have slightly spread and the edges are golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Let the cookies completely cool.</li>
       </ol>
